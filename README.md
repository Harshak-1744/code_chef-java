## Problem Description

King loves to go on tours with his friends.

King has N cars that can seat 5 people each and M cars that can seat 7 people each. Determine the maximum number of people that can travel together in these cars.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M, representing the number of 5-seaters and 7-seaters, respectively.

## Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of people that can travel together.

## Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ N, M ≤ 100

## Sample Input

```
4
4 8
2 13
14 5
8 8
```

## Sample Output

```
76
101
105
96
```

## Explanation

- Test case 1: King has 4 cars that seat 5 each and 8 cars that seat 7 each. So, 4 * 5 + 8 * 7 = 76 people can travel together.

- Test case 2: King has 2 cars that seat 5 each and 13 cars that seat 7 each. So, 2 * 5 + 13 * 7 = 101 people can travel together.

- Test case 3: King has 14 cars that seat 5 each and 5 cars that seat 7 each. So, 14 * 5 + 5 * 7 = 105 people can travel together.

- Test case 4: King has 8 cars that seat 5 each and 8 cars that seat 7 each. So, 8 * 5 + 8 * 7 = 96 people can travel together.
